# Concole program for management your class list with login-registration System. 

### This program has a really simple functional:
- You should register if you don't have account here. All info will be saved in the file "data.txt"
- Then you will see menu with that you can see you profile, see list of your students, add/delete student and of course exit :)

Before start you need to open LoginRegistrationSystem.java and StudentList.java file and replace path to "data.txt" with path on you PC for first case and path to students folder for second case.


### Bit about it
Currently, this program is most hardest my project in java. Maybe this program can has some litle bugs, so sorry in advance)
Usless fact: I wrote it in a couple of days and this program has ~300 lines of code.
